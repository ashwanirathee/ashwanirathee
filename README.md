Hi, I am Ashwani Rathee. I am a graduate student at UCSC doing masters in computer science.  I work on computer vision and graphics, specifically working with XR glasses for scene understanding currently. In past, I contributed to open source via GSOC'22, OSPP'21, GSSOC'21, PSOC'20. Also I helped to organize [Image Processing Workshop](https://github.com/JuliaImages/JuliaCon23_ImageProcessingWorkshop) at JuliaCon'23.

#### ðŸ”“ Open-Source Work:
- [ExifViewer.jl](https://github.com/JuliaImages/ExifViewer.jl): Exif IO support
